      The Earliest Film: The first recorded film ever created was Roundhay
      Garden Scene (1888), a brief 2.11-second clip filmed by inventor Louis Le
      Prince in France. Longest Film in History: The record for the longest
      movie goes to Logistics (2012), which runs for a staggering 857 hours, or
      roughly 35 days and 17 hours. Lightsaber Sound Secrets: The iconic noise
      of a lightsaber from Star Wars is a mix of a film projectorâ€™s hum and the
      sound produced by a microphone brushing against a TV set. Alfred Hitchcock
      Cameos: Director Alfred Hitchcock made a cameo appearance in almost every
      film he made, often appearing in the background as a fun Easter egg for
      keen-eyed viewers.
